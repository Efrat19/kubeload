# Kubeload

UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## What is it

This operator is a layer above kubernetes jobs that allows you to manage them in much easier and IAC-oriented way.
I came up with the idea when load-testing my site, because I manually had to increase the load every time
this operator will let you configure your loadtest's initial load, max load, interval and hatch-rate, and you will also be able to freeze or reset it any time.

## Local Build
